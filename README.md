# Exzellenz

EXZELLENZ is a pure-Java program to manipulate table data in Oracle database through Microsoft Excel file (in xls and xlsx formats). Using Apache POI and JDBC API, this program can be used to download, insert, update, and delete data in database tables. Unlike Oracle WebADI or Fusion ADFDI, thos program **does not use any Office VBA**, so you don't need to mess up the Excel security settings, and no need to worry the 32/64bit compatibility. 

Written in Pure-Java means that you can also run this program in Windows, *nix or Mac environment, as long as you maintain the file in Excel format (through Open/Libre Office).
